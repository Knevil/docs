In order for you to swap your `AION ERC-20` Tokens into `AION` Coins, you will be using MyEtherWallet or MyCrypto. To use these interfaces you will need to have:
- `AION ERC-20` Tokens stored in one of the following wallets: **MetaMask**, **Ledger**, **Trezor**, **Digital Bitbox**, and **Secalot**

- An `AION` Coin wallet address using either the official [Aion Desktop wallet](doc:create-an-aion-wallet) (Windows, Mac, Linux), or a **Coinomi** wallet.

It is not recommended, however, you can also use a keystore file, your private key, or a mnemonic phrase to initiate the transfer using a partner in the next step.
