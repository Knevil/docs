Based on your inputs in the Bridge UI we have pre-populated the fields in MyCrypto. No other inputs are required for you to input. **Altering any of the fields can result in a transaction failure or loss of funds.**

1\. You should now be on legacy.mycrypto.com. Double check that the URL is `https://legacy.mycrypto.com/` and the certificate is signed by `MyCrypto, Inc (US)`.

3\. The following fields are pre-populated:

- **To Address**: the Aion Token contract (`0x4CEdA7906a5Ed2179785Cd3A40A69ee8bc99C466`)

- **Data**: the code string of characters "Data" was generated by the Bridge Transfer UI using the inputs you provided 

- **Gas Limit**: `100000`

4\. The **Amount to Send** field is empty. It is important that you **do not enter a value into this field**. The value of the transaction is stored within the **Data** field, and duplicating this information will cause an error.
5\. Confirm that all the information is correct!   :100:
