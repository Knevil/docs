This is a list of exchanges that are verified and will swap your `AION ERC-20` tokens into `AION` coins. Exchanges are removed once they complete their Token Swap allocation. You should have your [Aion wallet](doc:step-1-create-a-wallet-that-will-receive-your-aion-coins-from-the-exchange) ready to receive your `Aion` coins.
