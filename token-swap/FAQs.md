## What is the Recovery Period?

The next few weeks are being refered to as the _recovery period_. Since the token swap has ended, you have up until 10th December 2018 to finish the swap process using the Aion Token Bridge, or up until 21st December 2018 to finish the swap process using Changelly. Changelly is the only exchange available now. No other exchanges are supported by Aion. Do not use any other exchanges other than Changelly.

## Can I keep my `AION ERC-20` and not participate in the Swap?

No. There will be no future utility for the `AION ERC-20` token after the swap period, and consequently, we will be removing support for the `AION ERC-20` token at the end of November. If you opt out of the token swap process your `AION ERC-20` tokens will not retain their value in the future.

## How much `AION ERC-20` can I transfer at a time?

There is a balance maintained on the bridge contract at all times. If your amount exceeds this balance the Aion Token Transfer Bridge will not let you generate the transaction and will ask you to try again. If your transaction fails to generate and you think it may be due to an attempt at sending a large amount of `AION ERC-20` tokens, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aion.network">support@aion.network</a>.

## When is the deadline for swapping my `AION ERC-20` Tokens?

The swap window will be between **September 2018** and **November 2018**. Parts of the swap have already begun, and the whole process will be completed by end of **November 2018**.

## Do I have to swap?

Yes.

## But why?

We require all `AION ERC-20` tokens to be swapped for `AION Coins`, as the full supply of `AION Coin` is necessary for the healthy operations and the crypto-economic design of the network. The existing `Aion ERC-20` tokens are not compatible with main net and bidirectional bridging. This is a mandatory upgrade.

Read the <a href="https://aion.network/media/en-aion-token-overview-v2.pdf" target="_blank">Aion Token paper Overview</a>  for further information.

## What if I don’t swap during the swap window?

There will be no future utility for the `AION ERC-20` token and consequently, we will be _end-of-life’ing_ the token at the end of November 2018. If you do not migrate your `AION ERC-20` tokens, they will not be supported by the Aion Foundation, Aion Network, 3rd Exchanges or 3rd party Wallets. Only limited support will be available after the swap window closes, so you should swap during the window.

## How many `AION Coins` will I get for my ERC-20 tokens?

The swap will be done at a 1 to 1 rate, so you will receive 1 `AION Coin for 1 `AION ERC-20` token.

## Will the swap cost me anything?

If you use Aion’s Token Transfer bridge there will be no cost for the swap, other than the Ethereum gas cost for the transaction (this value has volatility based on network conditions, you can view gas costs at <a href="https://www.ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">https://www.ethgasstation.info/</a>). If you use an exchange there may be a small transaction fee for facilitating the swap. You will need to check with each exchange for their transaction fees.

## How do I migrate my `AION ERC-20` Tokens?

There are two paths for managing the swap:

1) **Exchanges** — We are working with a group of global and regional exchanges to provide support for the swap across our diverse community.** In the coming weeks, we will be updating a list of our partner exchanges that will be supporting the swap. These exchanges will allow you to deposit ERC-20 tokens during the swap period and at the conclusion, you will be able to withdraw AION coins.

2) **Bridge** — You can access the bridge through our Bridge UI and wallet interfaces such as MEW and MyCrypto. To create your new Aion public address to input into the Bridge UI, utilize either the  Aion Desktop Wallet or Coinomi. From the Bridge UI and supporting tools you will be able to send your Aion ERC-20, check on the status of your bridge transaction and receive your AION Coins.

## How do I store and interact with my `AION Coin`?

You may store your `AION Coin` with any exchange or wallet which supports the `AION coin`. Follow [our blog](https://blog.aion.network/) for news on any new third-party entities which offer `AION coin` support.

## Why am I seeing dual `AION` listings on some exchanges

Several exchanges will be hosting the new `AION Coin` while simultaneously hosting the legacy `AION ERC20` coin. Although the legacy `AION ERC-20` token will no longer be supported by the Aion Foundation, Aion Network or any third parties it will still be present on exchanges for a short period of time. Over time — the `AION ERC-20` token will no longer be on exchanges and the only Aion asset listed on exchanges will be the `AION Coin`.
