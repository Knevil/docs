This section will take you through installation of the [Aion solo mining pool](doc:solo-mining-pool), which should be used with the [external miner](doc:external-miner). During the initial Kilimanjaro (Aion Phase 1) launch, only the Aion solo miner was officially supported on the network. We have since released Aion pool mining software for individuals to run their own pools:

A solo pool has one node mining for rewards at the network difficulty, with the full payout to the one account. With a public pool (not covered in this document), a group of nodes work together, distributing a reward proportional to each node's work when a block is mined by the pool. Often, there are fees associated with joining a public pool, and although rewards are received more consistently in a public pool, this may not guarantee benefit over solo-mining.

You can find a list of public pools that mine Aion under [External Resources](doc:external-resources).
