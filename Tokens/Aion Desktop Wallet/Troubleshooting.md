# Problems with Ledger

If you're having problems connecting your Ledger wallet to your Aion wallet, take a look at the troubleshooting steps below.

1. Make sure that the Aion app is installed on your Ledger wallet. Ledger have posted a guide on [how to install the Aion app](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008599834-Aion-AION-).
2. You need to have the Aion app **open** on your Ledger wallet when you connect. Open the Aion app on the Ledger and _then_ try to connect.
3. Make sure that the **contract data** is set to **on** within the Aion app on your Ledger.

If you're still having issues after following these steps, please reach out to us at [support@aion.network](mailto:support@aion.network) or through any of [our community groups](http://aion.network/community/). We have encountered a decent amount of issues with Ledger in the latest Aion Desktop Wallet build, are we're currently trying to find a solution.

# Windows and Antivirus Software

Due to the nature and fast release of the Aion Desktop Wallet, the `.exe` is not signed. This can cause certain installations of Windows and / or antivirus software such as McAfee and AVG to flag the wallet as malicious.

You may also encounter the following error: `CreateProcess failed code: 1450 insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.`

We recommend validating your download, and then adding exception in your antivirus software for the Aion Desktop Wallet. The exception can be made temporarily until you have completed the swap process.
