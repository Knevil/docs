Title: Get Test Coins
---

Test faucets are a way for developers to get some cryptocurrency to test with. This faucet is in it's early stages, and we understand that it's inconvenient. We are working on implementing this faucet function into a website, which will be released soon.

The Aion faucet is currently connected to the [`mastery_faucet` Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/aionnetwork/mastery_faucet). In order to receive `AION` from the faucet:

1. Sign up or login to [Gitter](https://gitter.im/)
2. Search for `mastery_faucet` and join the **Aion Mastery Faucet** channel.

3. Paste your public address into the channel.

    }
  ]
}

4. A few seconds later the _faucet-bot_ will reply saying your request has been processed.

5. You should now have 1 `AION` in the address you supplied.

# Restrictions

- The faucet can only be used 1 per day by the Gitter user. But, one Gitter user can request `AION` for more than one Aion account per day.
- The faucet will only deploy 1 `Aion` per account.
