# External Miner

There are two types of miners that are options for external mining:

- [CPU](cpu-miner)
- [GPU-CUDA](gpu-cuda-miner)

GPUs have a more specialized and specific architecture than CPUs, making them faster for mining and increases the potential `AION` reward. However, the specific hardware required for GPU-CUDA mining (NVIDIA 387.34+) may require separate installation onto your machine, and thus CPU mining may be more convenient.
