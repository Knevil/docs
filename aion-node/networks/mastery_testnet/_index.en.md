# Mastery Testnet

This is the guide for the [Aion Mastery testnet](https://mastery.aion.network/#/dashboard).

If you don't have an existing testnet you wish to migrate, you can:

1. [Download Mastery here](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/releases/tag/v0.3.0.q)
2. Extract the files and navigate into the `aion` directory
3. Launch the testnet kernel by running:

```bash
./aion.sh
```

This will begin syncing your node from genesis. Note that any changes made to ``config.xml`` requires you to re-deploy the node. For more indepth instructions on how to install a local node on the _Mastery_ test nework, see [Native Node](/aion-node/node-setup/native_node).

## Migrating from Conquest to Mastery

Before the migration, you should also backup the `keystore` and `config` folders from the aion kernel for the Conquest network.

1. Download the release build for the Mastery testnet from the [releases page](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/releases/tag/v0.3.0.q)
2. Extract the files to your desired location. This will also be where you will be running your testnet node
3. If you made any changes in the Conquest `config.xml` file (in the config folder), please copy the changes into the new Mastery `config.xml` file in its config folder
4. Remove the `<threads>1</threads>` inside the `config.xml` file if you are using RPC as your client API connection
5. Copy the **keystore** folder from the Conquest aion kernel folder into the Mastery aion kernel folder
6. Save all changes made, and relaunch the testnet from your new Mastery directory with:

```bash
./aion.sh
```

## Reset Configuration Settings

If your configuration settings are broken, or if you just want to start with a fresh configuration file with the default settings, you can reset the file:

1. Remove the `config.xml` file
2. Launch the node by running:

```bash
./aion.sh -c
```

This will create a new `config.xml` file with the default config settings. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the contents of [this file](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/blob/testnet_q3_mastery/modBoot/resource/`config.xml`).

Make sure you have the seed nodes from the above linked file in your `config.xml` file before starting the kernel.

## Obtaining Test Currency

To interact with the testnet, you will require currency. Follow the [Test Faucet guide](dapp-development/test-coin-faucet) to learn how to get test coins.
