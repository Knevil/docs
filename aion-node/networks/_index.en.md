# Networks

There are three options for connecting to an Aion network.

## Mainnet

This is the live network, where real transactions are processed. `AION` has real-world value here, and transactions are processed by real-world miners.

## Testnet (_Mastery_)

This test network is sometimes called _Mastery_. It is intended to be used as a testing environment for developers and miners to configure their applications before releasing them on the main network. `AION` has no value on this network, and cannot be exchanged for any real-world money.

## Custom Network

You can create a custom blockchain network for your infrastructure.
