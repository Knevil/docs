# Fast VM

Get up to speed quickly by using Aion's FastVM. This virtual machine functions exactly the same as a local node, but without the fuss of having to build everything manually. There are currently two ways to run the FastVM:

- [Virtual Machine on Ubuntu](ubuntu-method)
- [Docker Image](docker-method)
