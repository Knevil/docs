# Node Setup

In order to interact with the Aion network, you need a node to run things through. Luckily there are several methods that you can follow to set up your node. Pick the method that works best for you!

## [Spin up the Aion Virtual Machine](avm)

**Utilise Java's 15 years of expertise in virtual machine development.**

If you're not sure where to start, start here. The Aion Virtual Machine (AVM) is a Turing complete execution engine built on top of Java's virtual machine.

## [Build a Native Kernel](native-nodes)

**Host an Aion Node on your own hardware in Ubuntu.**

Building and running your own node gives you the most control over how to set things up. Things like geographical location and hardware may be important to you. This is especially true if you plan on running a mining operation. This comes at the cost of added complexity, and it can take a long time to sync with the network. We don't recommend this method if you're new to either Blockchain development or the Linux operating system.

## [Spin up a Fast VM](fast-vm)

**Run a pre-compiled and pre-synced copy of an Aion node that can be spun-up on any operating system.**

This is perfect if you are developing on Aion and will likely have to _rebuild_ the node often. This type of node is pre-synced which shortens the build time compared to building your own. You still need to take into account the resources that the Fast VM uses. You can use this method on any operating system that has Docker installed.

## [Connect to a Hosting Service](hosting-services)

**Connect to a node that is already running and synced up, hosted by a third-party company.**

This is the fasted method to get up and running. All you need to do is sign up to one of the supported providers, and connect to the node. We recommend this method to developers who want to get up and running fast. This method needs a constant internet connection, with limited customizability for each node.
