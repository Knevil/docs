# Tokens

Blockchains, like the Aion network, use tokens to move and manage data. They can also be used to purchase goods and services, just like physical currency. This section contains information on how to manage your `AION` and keep it safe.

If you're creating an application on Aion and need some `AION` coins to test it with, checkout the [Get Test Coins guide](get-test-coins).
