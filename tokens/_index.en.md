# Tokens

Blockchains, like the Aion network, use tokens to move and manage data. They can also be used to purchase goods and services, just like physical currency. This section contains information on how to manage your `AION` and keep it safe.

## [Aion Desktop Wallet](aion-desktop-wallet)

Learn how to install and manage you `AION` coins using the Aion Desktop Wallet. It is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## [Ledger Hardware Wallet](ledger-hardware-wallet)

Instead of storing your `AION` on a computer, you can use a hardware wallet. The Ledger wallet series support `AION`. Learn how to manage your `AION` using the Ledger hardware wallets.

## [Get Test Coins](get-test-coins)

Do you need some `AION` to test your blockchain application on the testnet? Then this is the section for you. Testnet coins hold no actual value, and cannot be converted to real `AION`.
