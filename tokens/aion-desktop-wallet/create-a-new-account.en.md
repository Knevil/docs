# Create a New Account

You can create a completely brand new account within the blockchain, or recover an account into this wallet using your **Mnemonic** and **Password**.

To create a completely brand new account:

1. Click **Add account**.
2. Create an **Account name.** This can be changed later if you want.
3. Enter a strong **Password**.
4. Confirm your **Password**.
5. Save and backup the seed mnemonic that is shown. You will need this if you wish to recover your wallet later.

To recover a previously used account that is somewhere in the blockchain:

1. Click **Add account**.
2. Under **Recover from seed**, enter the **Mnemonic** and **Password** associated with your account.
3. The recovered account is now shown under the **Accounts** tab.

## Multiple Accounts

Once an account has been created or recovered, you can quickly add further accounts by clicking **Add account**. You do not have to enter a password or record another mnemonic, as all accounts are held within the one wallet.
