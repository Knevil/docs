To recover a previously used account that is somewhere in the blockchain:

2\. Under **Recover from seed**, enter the **Mnemonic** and **Password** associated with your account.
3\. The recovered account is now shown under the **Accounts** tab.

You may wish to save your accounts created on the Aion Wallet elsewhere. In this case, you will need to export the wallet (using the icon right of the accounts listing) and save the keystore file in your desired location. The password you input here will be the new password to access the keystore file:

1\. Go to **Accounts**.
2\. Click the **Export** button on the account you wish to export.
3\. Click **Keystore File Destination**.
4\. Navigate to where you want to save the file to, and click **Open**.
5\. Enter a **Password** for this file.
6\. Click **OK**.

You have the option to transact AION and send it to another wallet. The receiving wallet must accept native `AION` coins.

1\. Click the **Lock** icon to unlock the account you wish to send `AION` coin from.
2\. Go to the **Send** tab.
3\. Under **New transaction** input the **Address** you are sending `AION` coin to.
4\. Enter the **Amount to send** in `AION` coin. Your **Account balance** must be higher than value in the **Amount to send** field. Keep in mind that every transaction comes with a `GAS` payment.
5\. Click on **Generate transaction** to send the `AION`.

## Handling Errors

Sometimes things get hung-up when sending a transaction, so the wallet tries to display helpful error messages when possible.

### Sending transaction...

If this message shows for more than a few seconds, make sure that your Aion node is fully synced. You transaction will not occur unless it is up to date.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
### You have transactions that require your attention!

This often means that the transaction failed. Click the notification to resubmit the transaction.
