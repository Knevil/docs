The method for opening the Aion Desktop Wallet differs depending on which operating system you are using.

# Linux

You need to run the `aion_ui.sh` file to open the wallet. You may want to add this command to your `.bashrc` file to make it easier to open in the future.

```bash
echo  'alias aion-wallet=~/aion_ui/aion_ui.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

This above command will allow you to open the Aion Desktop Wallet by running `aion` from a terminal, provided that you unpacked the `aion_ui.zip` to your home `~` directory.

# Mac and Windows

On Mac and Windows, you can open your wallet simply by clicking on the **AionWallet** application.
