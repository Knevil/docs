# Sync to a Remote Node

If you are not running a local Aion node, you will need to specify the remote node you wish to connect to under the **Settings** tab.

1. Open the Aion Desktop Wallet and go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Under the **Connection** drop-down, select **Add connection**.
3. Enter the **Connection name**, **URL**, **Port**, and **Access key** for your remote node.
4. The **Account lock timeout** is the length of time the Aion Desktop Wallet will wait while inactive before disconnecting.
