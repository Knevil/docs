You may wish to save your accounts created on the Aion Wallet elsewhere. In this case, you will need to export the wallet (using the icon right of the accounts listing) and save the keystore file in your desired location. The password you input here will be the new password to access the keystore file:

1. Go to **Accounts**.
2. Click the **Export** button on the account you wish to export.
3. Click **Keystore File Destination**.
4. Navigate to where you want to save the file to, and click **Open**.
5. Enter a **Password** for this file.
6. Click **OK**.
