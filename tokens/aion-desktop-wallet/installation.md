# Installation

The Aion Desktop Wallet is a local application that is **stored and ran from your local machine**. It is not a cloud application. If you're looking for a wallet that you can access from your phone, tablet, or computer, take a look at [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/).

The Aion Desktop Wallet can be installed on the following operating systems:

## Windows

1. If you don't already have it, download and install the [latest stable Java release](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
2. Download the `AionWalletSetup.exe` executable from the [Aion Wallet repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/Desktop-Wallet/releases).
3. Run the `.exe` on your computer. Accept any security warnings that pop up.
