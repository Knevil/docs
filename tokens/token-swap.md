# The Token Swap has now Ended

The Aion Token Swap Bridge ended on 10th December, and Changelly stopped it's token swap service on 21st December.

We’ve concluded the official swap period with over 97% swapped. If you missed the swap period and are currently holding `AION ERC-20` Tokens, don’t worry. You will be able to swap your tokens. We will be launching a self-service swap mechanism in January 2019 to facilitate any remaining tokens to be swapped.

If you have any questions, [feel free to reach out to us](mailto:hello@aion.network).
