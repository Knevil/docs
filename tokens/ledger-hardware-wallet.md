The Ledger Nano S is a hardware wallet that connects to your computer through USB. It functions as a more secure way to store your private keys for AION accounts, and supports various other cryptocurrencies as well. An individual accessing a Ledger hardware wallet would need to have both the physical device and PIN code to access their crypto assets, and each transaction will need to be confirmed through the hardware wallet in order to be processed.

You will need to install the Aion app on your Ledger device to manage AION coins with the Aion Desktop Wallet (walkthrough below). The Aion app is developed and supported by the [Aion community](https://aion.network/).

# Troubleshooting

If you're having problems connecting your Ledger wallet to your Aion wallet, take a look at the troubleshooting steps below.

1. Make sure that the Aion app is installed on your Ledger wallet. Ledger have posted a guide on [how to install the Aion app](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008599834-Aion-AION-).
2. You need to have the Aion app **open** on your Ledger wallet when you connect. Open the Aion app on the Ledger and _then_ try to connect.
3. Make sure that the **contract data** is set to **on** within the Aion app on your Ledger.
