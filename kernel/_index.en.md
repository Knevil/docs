# Kernel Overview

Mainstream adoption of blockchains has been limited because of scalability, privacy, and interoperability challenges. Aion is a multi-tier blockchain network designed to address these challenges.

Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created to solve unique business challenges within unique industries. As such, the Aion network is designed to support custom blockchain architectures while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain interoperability.

The [Aion White Papers](https://aion.network/developers/#whitepapers) provides more details regarding our design and project roadmap.

## System Requirements

- **Ubuntu 16.04** or a later version
