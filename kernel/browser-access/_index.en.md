# Browser Access

Allowing browsers to access the Aion kernel will enable users to interact with the blockchain without having to install complicated software on their device. Lowering the barrier to entry for users to access Web3 infrastructure is incredibly important.

There are currently two methods to allow this: [Web3.js](web3-js) and [Ethers.js](ethers-js). Both avenues are JavaScript based, and are incredibly simple to incoroprate into an existing web development project.
