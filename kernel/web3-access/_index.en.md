# Web3 Access

Allowing browser to access the Aion kernel will enable users to interact with the blockchain without having to install complicated software on their device. Lowering the barrier to entry for users to access Web3 infrastructure is incredibly important.

There are currently two methods to allow this: [Web3.js](web3-js) and [Ethers.js](ethers-js).
