# Mainnet

The mainnet is the _production_ network for Aion. This is where all real-world transactions happen, and `AION` used on this network has real-world value. By default, the kernel will connect to this network, unless instructed to do otherwise.

You can view metrics and information about this network on the [Aion Mainnet Dashboard](https://mainnet.aion.network/#/dashboard).

## Reset Configuration Settings

If your configuration settings are broken, or if you just want to start with a fresh configuration file with the default settings, you can reset the file:

1. Delete the `aion/mainnet/config/config.xml` file
2. Launch the kernel by running:

```bash
./aion.sh
```
