Accessing each part of the Aion ecosystem is as simple as querying a certain API. Both the kernel distributions have their own API, with the Rust kernel mirroring the functionality found within the Java kernel. Web3.js and Ethers.js are Javascript frameworks that make it easier to interact with blockchain networks from a browser. Finally, there are two integrations guides that contain useful information for linking up your exchange to the Aion network, or adding `AION` into your wallet application.
