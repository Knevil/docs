There are two public networks available on the Aion platform, **mainnet** and **mastery**.

# Mainnet

The mainnet is the main Aion network. This is where users spend their `Aion` and where live dApps in production live.

# Mastery

This network is specifically designed for testing. All the `Aion` tokens created on this network are completely arbitrary, and don't have any value. `Aion` can be received from the [Aion Mastery fosset](#).
