# Aion Overview

There are three different sections of Aion:

- [The Blockchain Network](#section-blockchain-network)
- [The Crypto Currency](#section-crypto-currency)
- [The Non-Profit Foundation](#section-the-aion-foundation)

Each section helps to build to the whole Aion ecosystem.

## Blockchain Network

Blockchain is a difficult concept to understand. It boils down to storing data in such ways that it can't be edited once it's committed. It's a collection of computers that share processing power and process transactions. It is also where the programs and functions that decentralized applications are stored and ran from.

Don't worry if that was a bit confusing, *blockchain* is a difficult concept to grasp. If you'd like to read more about what a blockchain is and how they work, head on over to [Aion University](https://learn.aion.network/docs/what-is-a-blockchain-network).

## Crypto Currency

You've likely heard of things like *Bitcoin*, *Ethereum*, and *Dogecoin*. These are all examples of crypto-currency. A form of digital money that can buy products and services.

`AION` coin is the currency of the Aion network, and is used to process transactions that run on the network. Like Bitcoin, `AION` coin can buy things and can be traded through exchanges.

## The Aion Foundation

The Aion foundation is a non-profit based in Toronto. As a quick history lesson: Nuco was a company set up to create and develop the Aion blockchain. In July 2018 the company moved from a corporate model to a non-profit foundation model. [We published a blog post explaining this move in more detail](https://blog.aion.network/aion-foundation-launches-cd908d00a586).

We want Aion to succeed, and we need decentralized app developers to do that. So our focus is to simplify the development process. This includes everything from creating *Hello World with Aion* tutorials, to awarding grants for exciting projects! Everyone at the Aion foundation has been hired to help you.
